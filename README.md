# 👋 Hi, I'm David Swider!

🎖️ **Former Military Data Analyst** turned 💻 **Full Stack Web Developer** with a passion for solving complex problems and building clean, responsive, and secure web applications.

## 🧠 About Me

After serving in the military as a Data Analyst, I transitioned into tech to combine my analytical background with creativity and modern development practices. I recently completed the Full Stack Web Development Certificate program at UConn, where I built a wide range of projects from dynamic websites to CI/CD pipelines.

I enjoy working across the entire stack — from crafting interactive UIs with **React** to building secure APIs using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **GraphQL**. I'm also skilled in testing with **Cypress** and managing deployment with **Render**.
